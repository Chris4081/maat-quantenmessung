# Maat-Guided Quantum Measurement

## 🧠 Description

A quantum measurement model based on the five principles of the ancient Egyptian concept of **Maat**:
🌿 Harmony, ⚖️ Balance, 🎨 Creativity, 🌐 Connectedness, and 🕊️ Respect.
Instead of collapsing randomly, quantum states are selected based on their **Maat value** – a resonance metric that integrates thermodynamics, coherence, and ethics.

## 📈 Simulation Overview

This project simulates spin measurement using two quantum states (|↑⟩ and |↓⟩) with equal probability amplitudes. Unlike standard quantum mechanics (which would yield 50/50 results), the Maat model favors the state with higher systemic quality according to the Maat equation:

```
Maat = (H * B * S * V * R) / ΔE
```

Where:

* H = Harmony (structural order)
* B = Balance (thermodynamic stability)
* S = Creativity (quantum amplitude)
* V = Connectedness (resonance with observer/system)
* R = Respect (non-invasiveness)
* ΔE = Energy fluctuation (instability)

---

## 🔬 Core Results

* 100 simulations × 1000 measurements
* Standard QM: 50.00% |↑⟩, 50.00% |↓⟩
* **Maat model result:** \~96% |↑⟩, \~4% |↓⟩ (strong preference)

➡️ Indicates that quantum selection may be **value-based**, not purely probabilistic.
